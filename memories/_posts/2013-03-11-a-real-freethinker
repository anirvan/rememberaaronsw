I want to be honest: I didn't knew a think about Aaron and this is a shame. But I've read a very long
[article][1] about him and the things he's done. At the end I even cried. 

The way Aaron seemed to think about the world and society is very inspiring and it is an inspiration 
for myself. In someway he seems to lived in the wrong century like Friedrich Nietzsche did. 

Society just isn't ready for such ways to think and maybe will never be.
Society has too much outdated values and not enough interest in important things like freedom
It will take a lot of time until human kind can find a way to achive importan goals in life instead of money and fame.

Your thoughts will always spread the world and you inspired a lot of people. I wish I could have met you someday.

Thank you, Aaron.
